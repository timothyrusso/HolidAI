A smart travel planning assistant that leverages Google Gemini AI to create personalized trip itineraries. Simply input your destination, travel dates, budget, and number of travelers to receive customized travel plans tailored specifically to your needs - eliminating hours of research and planning.

## AI Model

HolidAI is powered by Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model, a state-of-the-art large language model specifically optimized for fast, efficient responses while maintaining high-quality outputs. The model is particularly well-suited for travel planning tasks due to its:

- **Speed**: The "Flash" variant is optimized for rapid response generation, ensuring quick itinerary creation
- **Context Understanding**: Advanced natural language processing capabilities to understand complex travel requirements
- **Personalization**: Ability to consider multiple factors like budget, preferences, and constraints when creating travel plans
- **Knowledge Base**: Extensive training on travel-related data, including destinations, activities, and cultural information

The model processes user inputs through a carefully designed prompt engineering system that ensures consistent, relevant, and practical travel recommendations.
